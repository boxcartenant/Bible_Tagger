Biblical Law Source Code License

Copyright (c) 2025 Fernando Faria

Biblical law – unlike most modern law systems – maximizes your freedom: to 
benefit from and use information, ideas, and other innovations, which may be 
copied and used without limit, and without depriving anyone else of their copy. 
Biblical law also forbids you from threatening civil government coercion upon 
people who use information in these ways. Copyright and patent coercion is 
Biblical theft, and must be stopped.

The restrictions in this license -- and correlated liberties -- are grounded 
in Biblical law, not mere human law. The restrictions apply because anyone who 
uses the software or source code is bound by the following commandments:

- "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor." Exodus 20:16
- "You shall not lie. You shall not deceive one another." Leviticus 19:11

The author(s) cannot revoke your liberty to use this software and associated 
documentation files (the "Software") because he or she is bound by the 
following commandments:

- "You shall not steal." Exodus 20:15
- "You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you take 
away from it, that you may keep the commandments of YHWH your God which I 
command you." Deuteronomy 4:2


Permission has been granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of the Software, to deal in the Software without restriction, including 
without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, 
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit 
persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following 
conditions:

No Mis-attribution: You must not mis-attribute the authorship of any part of 
this software or this software as a whole. This encompasses two 
responsibilities (to which Biblical law always binds you):

1) You may not lie and claim that you are the original author of the 
information
2) You may not falsify the original authorship by making any modifications 
while attributing the changes to the original author(s)

You may provide credit in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that 
suggests that the original author endorses you or your use of the software.

One neighbourly way you may do this would be to give credit to the originator, 
provide a link to the original software, and indicate if any changes were made. 
Attribution is not necessary, but necessarily accurate and truthful when 
included.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
